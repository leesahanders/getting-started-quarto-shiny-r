# Publishing

Notes for the developer:

This presentation is published to the RStudio demo server using push button publishing from the RStudio IDE.

It is also published to my quarto pub space. I run quarto publish quarto-pub from terminal after `cd`-ing in to the directory. Answer "Y" to overwrite my previous site and to use the correct account. For example, to publish this slide deck I'm running: `quarto publish quarto-pub 2024-git-demo.qmd`. It will need to be a quarto project. If you have an existing directory of documents that you want to treat as a project just invoke `quarto create-project` with no arguments from within the directory.

Preview with: `quarto preview quarto-for-reproducible-reporting-demo.qmd --to positslides-revealjs --no-watch-inputs --no-browse`

I can access my account and see my deployments at https://questionable.quarto.pub/.

Each piece of content, in order to be published, needs: 

- `_quarto.yml`
- `manifest.json`

I can set each one manually with this: 

```r
library(rsconnect)

setwd("C:/Users/LisaAnders/Documents/git/quarto-for-reproducible-reporting-demo/content-examples/report-mermaid-diagrams")
rsconnect::writeManifest()
rsconnect::writeManifest(appDir = getwd(), appPrimaryDoc = "getting-started.qmd", appMode="quarto-static")
```
